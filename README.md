# ud036_StarterCode
This is the first project in the Udacity full stack web development nanodegree.  It is essentially a page listing movies and shows I like.
The main change made from the starter code are adding a class for shows, as distinct from movies. Movies and Shows are displayed in two sections.  When clicked, movies show trailers while shows link to the show's wiki.  You can also hover over any movie or show for more info about it.

##QuickStart
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Ensure that you have python installed
3. run media_data.py and check out some of my favorite movies and shows.
